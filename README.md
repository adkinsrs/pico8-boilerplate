## What is the "Pico-8 Boilerplate"?

> ðŸ’¡ Tico-80 developer? I have ported this boilerplate here: https://github.com/ojdon/tic80-boilerplate

The Pico-8 Boilerplate is a basic template of common game logic and functionality for other game developers to use to base their Pico-8 games upon. 

## Features

The Pico-8 currently supports features such as:

* Basic Game Loop
* Basic Scene Management
* Common Global Variables (Screen width, screen height, etc)
* Common functionality (collision checking, etc)

## Have a request? 
Feel free to open a new issue with your request and I'll consider adding it to the boilerplate! ...When I have a spare moment! :)
